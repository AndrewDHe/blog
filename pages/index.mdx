# Zijian He

Hi, I'm Zijian He — a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas.  
I’m passionate about software engineering, especially web development, data systems, and building clean, impactful tools that make life easier.

This blog is built with **Next.js** and [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/), allowing me to focus on writing and sharing my journey as I grow in tech.

Here, I write about what I'm learning, from coding projects and interview prep to system design and technical notes.

Thanks for visiting — feel free to connect!
